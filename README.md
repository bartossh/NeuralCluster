# NeuroClusters

NeuroClusters is a package that aims to allow to distribute Neural Network over multiple machines.

This is fun project to play with writing NN framework by myself. 

I aim only to understand the NN better by playing with implementation of distributed NN.

Keep your expectations low.

## Technology

Project is fully written in Go programming language but uses [Raylib-go](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go) bindings.
[Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) is used for graphical user interface to manage neural networks clusters.

## Testing

Run tests and benchmarks with:

```sh
go test -v -bench . ./...
```

## Running

Work in progress.
